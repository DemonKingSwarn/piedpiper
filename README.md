## Introduction

The lossless image compression website provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and applying lossless compression algorithms to reduce the file size without sacrificing image quality. The compressed images can be downloaded or viewed directly on the website.

## Features

- Upload images in various formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF)
- Apply lossless compression algorithms to reduce file size
- Display and download the compressed images
- Simple and intuitive web interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/demonkingswarn/piedpiper.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the website.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project comes from the popular TV series Silicon Valley. The show highlights the challenges and innovations in the technology startup world. In one of the episodes, the characters develop a revolutionary lossless compression algorithm specifically for image files. This project aims to capture the essence of that concept and provide a simple implementation of a lossless image compression website.
